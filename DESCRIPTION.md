### Submitting Challenges

PuzzleTroll is built on user submitted challenges. If you feel you can author a fun challenge for other users, please submit it. A moderator will work with you if any changes need to be made, and guide you in the right direction until the challenge is ready to be tested.
Approved challenges will enter a beta stage where users can volunteer to test out and vote on whether your challenge should be added to the official list.
If your challenge was approved by enough beta users it will be added to our official list and you will receive points for authoring a challenge.

### Reporting problems

There is the ability to report issues with challenges. These things are expected to happen as our users are sent all over the internet and at times systems fail. If you find an issue with a challenge, please report it and our moderators and the author will look into resolving it as soon as possible.
