## Summary ##
  > With user-generated and moderator-managed challenges, we provide a fun and safe platform for users to explore the internet. Users will compete as they are exposed to new concepts and ideas they possibly otherwise wouldn't experience. Users will need to watch videos, read articles, scan photographs, write comments, interact with the internet at a deeper level all while looking for clues on how to solve the challenge at hand. Our goal is to encourage people to explore the vast source of information that is the Internet, learn some things, and have a great time in the process.
